# Sick-Fits: Advanced React + GraphQL
Sick Fits is a full stack online clothing store complete with real credit checkout. Users can search, sell, add to cart and checkout their favourite items.
The application has five main models — Users, Items, Orders, CartItems, and OrderItems — all of which are relational and showcase the power of relational GraphQL Queries.
The app also includes many server side bits including JWT authentication, permissions, sending email, uploading images, and charging credit cards.

In addition to building both the frontend and backend of the application, Testing the React application is included.
It’s GraphQL API with Node.js on the backend and React and Apollo on the front end.
We cover everything from authentication and sending email to uploading photos and caching data. The entire front-end is built in modern React.js and GraphQL.
