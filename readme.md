# Advanced React + GraphQL
Sick Fits is a full stack application (online store) with React.js and GraphQL.
Itâ€™s GraphQL API with Node.js on the backend and React and Apollo on the front end.
We cover everything from authentication and sending email to uploading photos and caching data. The entire front-end is built in modern React.js and GraphQL.
